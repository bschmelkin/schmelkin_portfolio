Run the program in a python environment by running main.py. The program will automatically decrease the battery level as well as automatically asign values for DUSTY_SPOT_SENSOR and which type of cleaning will be done. Each cycle represents 1s in the machine, and after each cycle it will prompt the user if they would like to continue cleaning. Typing in y or n will continue or cancel the program. The loop will run for 15 seconds before prompting the user. The implementation of the priority composite assigns priority in left to right order. In a more sophisicated system, the children would have priority values associated with them, but for the purposes of this program the priority is determined from left to right. When the child of the priority node with the highest priority finishes, the priority node is returned as SUCCESS without returning back to the other children. The decorator commands assist with the logic to continue the processes that were in motion if a child with a higher priority returns succeed. The logic for charging the battery takes place inside the main loop and not in the docking command. The docking task remains running until the main program loop increments the battery up to 100%. Furthermore, after the robot leaves the dock it immediately starts utilizing its battery. When the robot is making its way home, it  chooses from a 50% probability selector whether it reaches its goal or not. Spot Cleaning, General Cleaning, or none will be randomly selected ater a Done General or Done Spot command to simulate different modes that the robot could be in.
